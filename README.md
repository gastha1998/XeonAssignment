Respected sir/ma'am


Here is the Assignment for software testing internship. In this repository i have committed questions one and three. For question-1, I have used core java + selenium with chrome webdriver and you can find the code in 'src/Grofers.java'. For question-3, I have covered possible test cases for the purchase of Sony Headset from Flipkart.

I completed this assignment to best of my understandings from given assignment document. Let me know if you want me to do this assignment in any other way.
